v0.1-beta.5:
 - Improve the performance of the Hessenberg reduction phase by limiting
   the number of submitted tasks. This should reduce the task scheduling
   overhead.

v0.1-beta.4:
 - Fix a problem where infinite eigenvalues were detected too late.
 - Add an option to choose between the norm stable deflation condition
   (STARNEIG_SCHUR_NORM_STABLE_THRESHOLD) and and the LAPACK style deflation
   condition (STARNEIG_SCHUR_LAPACK_THRESHOLD). 

v0.1-beta.3:
 - Re-implemented Hessenberg reduction.

v0.1-beta.2:
 - Fix an installation-related bug.
 - Fix a MPI-related compile error.
 - Remove unused code.

v0.1-beta.1:
 - First beta release of the library.

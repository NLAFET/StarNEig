# Introduction

StarNEig library aims to provide a full suite of algorithms for solving
**non-symmetric** (generalized) eigenvalue problems. The library is built on top
of the *StarPU* runtime system and targets both shared memory and distributed
memory machines. Some components of the library support GPUs.

The four main components of the library are:

 - **Hessenberg(-triangular) reduction**: A dense matrix (or a dense matrix
   pencil) is reduced to upper Hessenberg (or Hessenberg-triangular) form.
 - **Schur reduction**: A upper Hessenberg matrix (or a Hessenberg-triangular
   matrix pencil) is reduced to (generalized) Schur form. The (generalized)
   eigenvalues can be determined from the diagonal blocks.
 - **Eigenvalue reordering**: Reorders a user-selected set of (generalized)
   eigenvalues to the upper left corner of an updated (generalized) Schur form.
 - **Eigenvectors**: Computes (generalized) eigenvectors for a user-selected
   set of (generalized) eigenvalues.

The library has been developed as a part of the NLAFET project. The project has
received funding from the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation
programme under grant agreement No. 671633. Support has also been received
from eSSENCE, a collaborative e-Science programme funded by the Swedish
Government via the Swedish Research Council (VR).

## Current status

The library is currently in a beta state and only real arithmetic is supported.
In addition, some interface functions are implemented as LAPACK and ScaLAPACK
wrappers.
